Node Frameworks
-------------------------
Frameworks give developers a structure they can use to build. Using web frameworks becomes essential while concentrating on web development, especially for building huge APIs or HTTP servers. These frameworks provide the essential building blocks and an organized base to enable jobs like building web APIs for web application interaction or providing static files for conventional websites. There are several frameworks available for Node.js, each with its own features and strengths.

Express:
 ----------------------
•	Probably the most popular Node.js framework is Express. It has a strong feature set for creating web apps and APIs, and it is simple and adaptable. Express is a well-liked option for developers of all ability levels because to its performance and ease of use.

Koa.js:
--------------------------
•	More modern compared to express. It makes use of ES6 capabilities and offers a more efficient networking technique, enabling programmers to create code that is clearer and more compact. Because of its adaptability and asynchronous handling, koa is frequently chosen.

Nest.js: 
----------------------------
•	Nest is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It uses TypeScript, which gives Node.js developers stronger typing and better tooling, and is greatly influenced by Angular. Nest is suited for large-scale enterprise applications because of its modular architecture and integrated support for technologies like dependency injection.

The choice of framework often depends on factors such as project requirements, developer preferences and familiarity with specific technologies.

Express:
-------------------
Express provides support for both web applications and web APIs. When considering apps, it is common to associate them with functionalities running in browsers or mobile devices. A powerful feature set for developing online apps and APIs is offered by Express.js, a flexible and compact Node.js web application framework. It provides an easy-to-use API for managing HTTP requests and replies, routing, middleware integration, and other features, which streamlines the process of developing server-side applications. Web applications can be developed quickly with it, and new middleware and plugins may be added with ease to enhance functionality as needed. Within the Node.js environment, Express is extensively used and has a sizable community with a wealth of developer resources and documentation. 

Socket.io
-------------------
Socket.io facilitates real-time, two-way, event-driven communication, addressing a limitation in Express, which only allows the client to initiate requests to the server. Bidirectional communication is made possible using Socket.io, allowing the server to send data and notifications to the client in response to specified events. There are two components to the mechanism: a server-side library for Node.js and a client-side library for browsers. Both have almost the same APIs and work in an event-driven fashion, just like Node.js.
